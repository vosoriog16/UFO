# UFO

# Purpose

The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a searchable database using Javascript, HTML, CSS and d3. This challenge consists of creating an interactive website that uses filters containing UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

The webpage can be used to find data on UFO sightings on specific dates, cities, states, countries and shapes.

Here is an example using the filters. When we filter by California, Orange and the light shape, it returns one sighting.

# Summary

One drawback of this design is that users must know exact locations and have correct capitalizations. If a user types with a capital letter in a city or state that is not capitalized, there will be zero returns. Also, only one date at a time can be searched rather than ranges, otherwise there will be zero returns. One of my recommendations would be modifying the date filter to make it easier for users to be able to search a range of dates. Another recommendation would be to allow for lower and uppercase spelling to make the searching criteria simpler for users.
