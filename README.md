# UFO

Purpose
The purpose of this analysis was to help Dana create a searchable database using Javascript, HTML, CSS and d3. This challenge consists of creating an interactive website that uses filters containing UFO sightings by date, city, state, country, and shape.

# Results

The webpage can be used to find data on UFO sightings on specific dates, cities, states, countries and shapes.
